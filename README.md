# Aerostat

Redis-backed highly-scale-able and cloud-fit media beam engine.

A prototype implementation of the core of the [Agile Media Blueprint](https://www.streampunk.media/agile-media-blueprint).

## Status, support and further development

Although the architecture of the aerostat beam engine is such that it could be used at scale in production environments, development is not yet complete. In its current state, it is recommended that this software is used in development environments and for building prototypes. Future development will make this more appropriate for production use.

Contributions can be made via pull requests and will be considered by the author on their merits. Enhancement requests and bug reports should be raised as github issues. For support, please contact [Streampunk Media](http://www.streampunk.media/).
